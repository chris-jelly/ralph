- Implemented robust path validation in `ralph/install.sh`.
- Added validation to ensure `TARGET_DIR` exists after expansion.
- Added validation to ensure `RALPH_DIR_NAME` parent directory exists (if outside the target directory).
- Created `tests/test_validation.sh` to verify error conditions.
- Files changed: `ralph/install.sh`, `tests/test_validation.sh`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When validating paths where `mkdir -p` will be used later, check if the path is a child of a known existing directory (like `TARGET_DIR`) to avoid false positives.
  - Bash string manipulation (prefix check) is sufficient for simple "is child of" checks if paths are canonicalized.
