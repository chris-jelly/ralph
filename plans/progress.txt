- Created `ralph/doctor.sh` validation script.
- Updated `ralph/install.sh` to install `doctor.sh`.
- Updated `ralph/ralph.sh` to support `--help` for verification.
- Files changed: `ralph/doctor.sh`, `ralph/install.sh`, `ralph/ralph.sh`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `doctor.sh` must be able to locate the installation relative to itself or the repo root.
  - `install.sh` must be updated whenever a new script is added to the distribution.
  - Scripts should support `--help` to allow basic runtime verification without side effects.
